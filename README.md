# Fungal Colony Image Analysis

This repository contains an automated workflow for analyzing fungal colony images from Petri plates, specifically designed for fungicide resistance assays. The goal is to **replace manual colony measurement with a reliable, reproducible, and faster workflow**.

---

## Features

- Automated image processing using **R** and the **EBImage** package.
- Colony isolation using **thresholding** and **morphological operations**.
- Calibration with a **reference label of known area** to convert pixels → cm².
- Works for **one Petri dish at a time**.
- Designed to handle a variety of **colony colors, shapes, and media backgrounds** (future updates aim to handle multicolored media/colonies).

## Files in the Repository

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Single Image Analysis.R` | R script for processing a single Petri dish image. |
| `Multiply Image Analysis.R` | R script (future/multi-image processing workflow). |
| `Single Image Analysis.qmd` | Quarto version of the single-dish workflow. |
| `Single Image Analysis.html` | Example HTML output generated by the Quarto workflow. |
| `Adobe2.jpeg` | Example Petri dish image used in testing. |
| `label.png` | Reference label image for pixel → cm² calibration. |
| `.Rhistory` | R session history (optional). |

## Getting Started

### 1. Install R packages

```r
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("EBImage")
```

### 2. Open the workflow
Single Image Analysis.R or Single Image Analysis.qmd contains all steps for analyzing one Petri dish image.

Update the file paths at the top of the script for your input image and label.

### 3. Run the workflow

For R script: Source the script in RStudio.

For Quarto: Knit the .qmd file to HTML to see results and overlay images.

Overlay images are saved to the folder specified in the script (single_image_overlay/).

### How the workflow works

Load and resize the Petri dish image.

Normalize and apply gamma correction to enhance colony contrast.

Convert to grayscale and threshold to create a binary mask of colonies.

Morphological cleaning to remove noise and refine colony edges.

Label connected components and identify the largest colony.

Calibrate colony area using a reference label to convert pixels → cm².

Save overlay image showing the largest colony in red.

### Notes

Current version handles one Petri dish at a time.

Calibration requires a reference label image with known area (label.png).

Future updates aim to support multicolored media and multiple colonies per plate.
